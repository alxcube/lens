{@link ImageInterface} is a base contract to produce image distortion.

Lens has built-in classes that implement ImageInterface for usage in browsers, but if
you want to use Lens in Node.js, you should make adapter for image processing library
that you use (see below).

### ImageInterface implementations for browser

#### {@link lens.image.Canvas}

This class is used to distort image from HTML5 canvas directly. Distortion result will contain
**new** canvas in it's `canvas` prop.

```javascript
var canvas  = document.querySelector('#canvas');
var image   = new lens.image.Canvas(canvas);

// Rotate by 180 deg using Affine distortion.
var distorted = lens.distort(
  image,
  lens.distorts.AFFINE,
  [0, 0, image.width - 1, image.height - 1, image.width - 1, image.height - 1, 0, 0],
  {
    async: false
  }
);

// Put image data on canvas.
canvas.getContext('2d').putImageData(
  distorted.data, // ImageData object
  0, 0
);

// ...or draw
canvas.getContext('2d').drawImage(distorted.canvas, 0, 0);

// ...or append new canvas to document
document.body.appendChild(distorted.canvas);
```

#### {@link lens.image.DomImage}

This class extends {@link lens.image.Canvas} and allows to distort `<img>` elements
directly. New dom `Image` object (`<img>` element) will be in `image` property of
distortion result. `canvas` property is still available, so you can use it too.

Keep in mind that `lens.image.DomImage#sync()` method, which is used internally, returns
promise, so {@link lens.distort} will also always return `Promise` regardless of
`{@link DistortionOptions}#async` option.

```javascript
function preload(src) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    var img = new Image();
    img.onload = () => resolve(img);
    img.src = src;
  });
};

preload(document.querySelector('#myImage').src)
.then(img => {
  var image = new lens.image.DomImage(img);
  
  return lens.distort(
    image,
    lens.distorts.AFFINE,
    [0, 0, image.width - 1, image.height - 1, image.width - 1, image.height - 1, 0, 0]
  );
})
.then(distorted => document.body.appendChild(distorted.image));
```

### Implementing ImageInterface in Node.js

Lens has abstract class {@link lens.image.AbstractImage}. You can extend it and override
only a few methods to make Lens work with image processing library that you use:

```javascript
var lens  = require('@alxcube/lens');

class MyImage extends lens.image.AbstractImage {
  constructor(image) {
    super(image.width, image.height);
    this.image  = image;
    // Your code
  }
  
  getImagePixelColor(x, y){
    // Your code
  }
  
  setImagePixelColor(x, y, color) {
    // Your code
  }
  
  prepareBlank(width, height){
    // Your code
  }
  
  getAverageColor() {
    // Your code
  }
  
  resize(width, height) {
    // Your code
  }
  
  sync() {
    // Your code
  }
}
```

#### `constructor`

In constructor you should call parent constructor with your image's width and height
as arguments.

Then you can store image at some property — then you can get distorted image from
that property of distortion result.

Also you can set `{@link ImageInterface}#quantumRange` property here, if your image
processing library supports different color depths. This is 255 by default.

If you wish, you can override other default properties such as `backgroundColor`,
`interpolationMethod` or `virtualPixelMethod`

#### `{@link lens.image.AbstractImage#getImagePixelColor}`

In this method you must return pixel color at given image coords (x, y). This method
is protected and is only called internally, so you don't need to check if (x, y) is
in image bounds — just return {@link Color}.

#### `{@link lens.image.AbstractImage#setImagePixelColor}`

In this methos you must set pixel located at (x, y) to the given {@link Color}.
You don't need to check if (x, y) is in image bounds.

#### `{@link lens.image.AbstractImage#prepareBlank}`

In this method you must return new instance of your class (or `Promise` that resolves
such instance) with empty image of given width and height. This will be the 'canvas'
on which distorted image will be drawn.

*If this method returns a `Promise` — {@link lens.distort} will also return promise,
regardless of `async` option.*

#### `{@link lens.image.AbstractImage#getAverageColor}`

This method must return average color of whole image. Basically, resizing source image
to 1x1 px and returning color of that pixel is enough. If you can't resize image
synchronously with your image processing library, you may compute it before creating
class instance, and then save calculated color in constructor.

#### `{@link lens.image.AbstractImage#resize}`

This method must return new instance of your class with image, resized to given width
and height. Alternatively, you can return `Promise` that resolves new instance.

*If this method returns a `Promise` — {@link lens.distort} will also return promise,
regardless of `async` option.*

#### {@link ImageInterface#sync}

You must implement this method if you use some separate storage for pixel data manipulation
(an array or something like that) so that to display processing result you must put
that data to image object in a special way. You can refer to 
{@link lens.image.Canvas#sync} source for better understanding.

If you implement this method, it must return either instance object itself (be chainable)
or a `Promise` that resolves this instance.

*If this method returns a `Promise` — {@link lens.distort} will also return promise,
regardless of `async` option.*
