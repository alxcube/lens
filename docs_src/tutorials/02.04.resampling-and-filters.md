### EWA Resampling and Filters

Once you know where a destination pixel 'hits' the source image, you need to determine
the color to make the destination pixel, using the pixels near the 'hit' point in the
source image.

Normally the {@link lens.distort} function will use the Area Resampling method EWA
(Elliptical Weighted Average) to average out a larger area of the source image to work
out the right color for this pixel.

You can change the filter using by EWA resampling using the
`{@link DistortionOptions}#filterPreset` option to use one of built-in presets,
or set your own filter object that implements {@link FilterInterface} using
`{@link DistortionOptions}#filter` option.

At the moment Lens supports following filter presets:
* {@link lens.filterPresets}.ROBIDOUX: [Robidoux Cylindrical Filter](
https://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#robidoux
)
* {@link lens.filterPresets}.ROBIDOUX_SHARP: [Robidoux Sharp Cylindrical Filter](
https://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#robidoux_sharp
)

If you are interested in deeper understanding of filters, you can find much more
detailed info at [ImageMagick Resampe Filters](
https://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/
) page, especially in [Cylindrical Filters](
https://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#cylindrical
) section.

#### Resampling Failure

In some special situations the EWA resampling Ellipse may fail to actually 'hit' any
real pixel for it to create a weighted average. Basically the ellipse is so small, or
so thin, that it falls completely between every pixel in the image. And without any
pixel colors, it can not generate a color for the output image at that point.

This is an extreme situation, and generally is impossible to achieve unless you are
playing with Expert Filter Settings. But in the unlikely event that no pixels are hit,
or the filter weights add up to zero, the resampling will fail. In that case Lens will
fall back to using a simple direct interpolated lookup, just like you would get if you
turn of EWA filtering (see next).

If you want to check if this is happening you can use the special
{@link lens.interpolation Background Interpolation} with a unusual background
color so as to highlight any such resampling failures.


### Interpolated, or Direct Color Lookup

You can set `{@link DistortionOptions}#resample` option to `false`, to turn off
filtering, and hence EWA resampling.

When this is done Lens will switch color lookups to use fast and simpler Pixel
Interpolation. That is it will look up a color using only a 'single point' reference
to the source image without any 'resampling area'. The color of the resulting pixels
will use a interpolated color based only on nearest neighbours to point.

Interpolation will generally cause sever aliasing effects when any form of
minification or down-sampling of the image occurs.

But it does work extremely well for images containing minimal distortions such as
rotations, tiling, or for image enlargement (magnification or up-sampling).
A Super Sampling technique can be combined with interpolation, to improve the results
in areas of strong compression, minification or down-sampling.
