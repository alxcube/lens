### Preparing image

The first thing you need to distort image is adapter class that provides access to image
pixel data via {@link ImageInterface}.

There are 2 built-in adapters in Lens.

```javascript
var canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
var img = document.getElementById('myImage');

// Using canvas directly
var canvasImage = new lens.image.Canvas(canvas);

// ...or using <img> element. It is good idea to preload image to be sure that it is complete
var preloader = new Image();
preloader.onload = () => {
  var domImage = new lens.image.DomImage(preloader);
};
preloader.src = img.src;
```

Before distortion you may want to change some image properties (see 
{@link ImageInterface} member properties):

```javascript
// Virtual pixel method
image.virtualPixelMethod = lens.vpx.BACKGROUND;

// Background color
image.backgroundColor = [255, 255, 0, 127]; // Semi-transparent yellow

// Interpolation method
image.interpolationMethod = lens.interpolation.AVERAGE_16;
```

After you have created adapter, you can distort image.

### Performing distortion

To distort image you should use {@link lens.distort} static method. It's arguments are:
* `image` — image object created above;
* `distortion` — distortion that you wish to apply to the image. It can be one of 
{@link lens.distorts} constants (which are actually distortion resolvers — see next) or
{@link lens~DistortionResolver} — function that resolves distortion object by distortion
arguments array and image, or it can be distortion object itself. In latter case third
argument will be *options* instead of *arguments*
* `args` — array of arguments for distortion. Each distortion accepts it's own arguments.
Their description you can find at {@link lens.distorts} docs. If `distortion` param was
given as {@link DistortionInterface} object, then `args` param is not used, and will
be casted as options object.
* `options` — object with distortion options. See {@link DistortionOptions} for detailed
description. If `distortion` param was given as {@link DistortionInterface} object,
then `options` param becomes third param.

{@link lens.distort} method returns new instance of {@link ImageInterface} (when `async`
option is set to false and image can be processed synchronously) or Promise that
resolves new image.

Note that distorting {@link lens.image.DomImage} will always return promise, regardless
`async` option. 

Example:
```javascript
// Sync
var distorted = lens.distort(image, lens.distorts.AFFINE, [0, 0, 10, 10], {async: false});


// Async
lens.distort(image, lens.distorts.AFFINE, [0, 0, 10, 10])
.then(distorted => {/* save result */});
```

### Working with distortion result

Distortion result is the new instance of driver that you used, so you can do whatever
you want with it.

The most important things in result is image itself and virtual viewport.

You can get image from distortion result's public property that depend on driver used:

* For {@link lens.image.Canvas} this is `canvas` property, and it is of `HTMLCanvasElement`
type. You can put it's contents to other canvas, insert it into DOM, save as file and
anything that you can do with canvas.

* For {@link lens.image.DomImage}  this is `image` property. It is of `Image` type which
is equivalent for `HTMLImageElement`. This driver is made for convenience to directly
distort `<img>` elements without creating canvas manually. The `canvas` prop is still
available. 

{@tutorial 02.06.virtual-viewport} always available at `viewport` property. You can use
it to compose distorted image at the correct position on larger canvas.
Keep in mind that depending on distortion and it's arguments and
`{@link DistortionOptions}#bestFit` option setting, the resulting image may be virtually
located far beyond original canvas bounds, or vice versa, viewport may be equal to original
image's viewport, but the distortion maps to somewhere beyond the original viewport.
